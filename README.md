The ultimate Minecraft damage deterrent.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️
I'm not going to tell you how to set this up like I did. It is an **unambiguously bad idea.** If you don't know what you're doing, just click away to another page--personally, I'd recommend [this one](https://theuselessweb.com). If you must do it, just don't be stupid. I take no responsibility for your well-being.
